# html-recipes
My first HTML project! Homepage and three pages for recipes. I've used basic HTML to embedd an images, bold and italic text, make a lists, headings, paragraphs and few other simple things. It's overall very simple, but I'm proud for the progress that I made so far. I've enjoyed every moment of the process and I will continue to enjoy, learn and grow.
