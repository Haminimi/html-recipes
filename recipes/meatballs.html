<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Grandma's tender and <strong>juicy</strong> meatball recipe simmered in a delicious 
    tomato sauce and served with spaghetti noodles, classic Italian food.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<h3>Tomato sauce</h3>
<ul>
    <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
    <li>½ cup yellow onions, minced</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
    <li>6 ounces tomato paste</li>
    <li>7 cups crushed canned tomatoes</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, plus more for seasoning</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h3>Meatballs</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 pounds ground beef, 80% to 90% lean meat</li>
    <li>2 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 cup breadcrumbs, plain or Italian-style</li>
    <li>½ cup parmesan cheese, freshly grated, plus more for garnish</li>
    <li>½ cup yellow onion, finely minced</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasonings, omit if using Italian-style breadcrumbs</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
    <li>¼ cup sliced basil, for garnish</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<h3>Tomato sauce</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a large pot or dutch oven, heat olive oil over medium-low heat. 
        Once hot, add the onion and garlic, sauté until onions are translucent, about 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute. 
        Stir in the crushed tomatoes, salt, and pepper. 
        Simmer covered, with lid slightly ajar to prevent splattering 
        for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Meatballs</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Set the oven rack to the lower-middle position and set it to broil. 
        Line a large baking sheet with foil and lightly grease it with olive oil. 
        Set aside. In a large bowl, add the ground beef, eggs, breadcrumbs, 
        parmesan cheese, minced onion, salt, black pepper, Italian seasoning, 
        and minced garlic. Use hands to mix thoroughly until combined.</li>
    <li>Measure and roll the ground beef mixture into ⅓ cup (3 ounces) rounds, about the size of an egg. 
        Evenly space the pieces on the baking sheet, there should be about 14 to 15 meatballs.</li>
    <li>Broil the meatballs until the surface is browned, about 10 to 12 minutes. Turn over and cook for
         an additional 2 to 3 minutes to lightly brown the other side.</li>
        <li>Transfer the meatballs to the tomato sauce. Cover the pot with the lid slightly ajar, simmer 
            on low heat for at least 1 ½ hours, checking and stirring every 20 minutes, or as needed. 
            The meatballs should be fork tender when sliced.</li>
        <li>At the end of cooking, adjust the consistency of the sauce with water if needed, about 1 
            tablespoon at a time. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Serve meatballs with spaghetti topped with sauce, sliced basil, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Storing: Cool completely and store in an airtight container for up to 5 days.</li>
    <li>Make it gluten-free: Use gluten-free breadcrumbs or almond flour.</li>
</ul>
