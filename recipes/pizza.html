    <li>1 cup pizza sauce</li>
    <li>2 cups baby spinach</li>
    <li>2 to 3 cups shredded low-moisture part-skim mozzarella cheese</li>

</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><a href="https://cookieandkate.com/easy-whole-wheat-pizza-dough/">Make the dough.</a> 
        Preheat the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit with a rack in the upper third of the oven. 
        If you’re using a baking stone or baking steel, place it on the upper rack.</li>
    <li>Spread pizza sauce evenly over the two pizzas, 
        leaving about 1 inch bare around the edges. 
        Evenly distribute the spinach on top of the sauce, followed by the cheese 
        (use all three cups if you want a cheesy pizza as shown here).</li>
        <li>Top the pizzas with artichoke, bell pepper, red onion, tomatoes, olives and almonds (if using).</li>
        <li>Bake pizzas individually on the top rack until the crust is golden and the cheese is golden and bubbly, 
            about 10 to 12 minutes (or significantly less, if you’re using a baking stone/steel—keep an eye on it).</li>
            <li>Transfer pizzas to a cutting board and sprinkle with with fresh basil, red pepper flakes and Parmesan, if using. 
                Slice and serve! Leftover pizza keeps well in the refrigerator for 4 days, 
                or for several months in the freezer.</li>
            
</ol>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
    <li>MAKE IT NUT FREE: Omit the almonds.</li>
    <li>CHANGE IT UP: On top of the mozzarella, use any combination of the suggested toppings (up to 3 cups t0tal). 
        The spinach and almonds are not essential.</li>
</ul>
